This code folder contains read_data() and save_data() versions in IDL, Matlab
and python. These can be used to read (and write) data in the .svd file format
that the Advanced MRI section uses to store most of its data.

It could be that certain dependent files are missing. If so, please email me so
that I can upload missing routines.

All of this code can be freely copied and reused, but the original header should
remain included.

If you happen to develop a reader (or writer) for .svd for software other than
what is presented here, please let me know so that I can include a link here
(or a copy, if you prefer).

Bug reports would also be greatly appreciated.
